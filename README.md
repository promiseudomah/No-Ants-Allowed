# No Ants Allowed

🐜 No Ants Allowed was created in just one week as part of my Rapid Game Prototyping course (Week 1). The theme for the week was: "Small but Fun."

I decided to recreate my childhood Ant Smasher game with some twists and now the ants can dodge!

The fun part
- It's a nostalgic tower defense kinda feel since the ants keep coming in waves. Can you stop them?

Controls
- Click on ants with your mouse to squash them!

💥 Be sure to use power-ups wisely as they have cooldowns!

Have fun! 🧊🐜

PS: The sounds are not the best, but they work. I was screaming "sugaaarr" for the whole week 😂. I also composed the beat on fl studio 😎🎹
